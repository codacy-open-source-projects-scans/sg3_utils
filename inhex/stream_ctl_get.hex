# Get stream status. Note that the sg_stream_ctl utility issues either
# a SCSI GET STREAM STATUS or STREAM CONTROL command. This is an example
# of the SCSI GET STREAM STATUS command.
#
# This can be tested with:
#    sg_stream_ctl --inhex=<this_file>
#
#
# For a STREAM CONTROL command example see the stream_ctl_open.hex file.
