#
# The SCSI STREAM CONTROL command yields parameter data which in the
# case of STR_CTL=1 (open) contains the newly opened Stream Identifier
# ASSIGNED_STR_ID. That field is 16 bits long and should not be 0.
# In the case of STR_CTL=2 (close) it seems 8 bytes of parameter data
# is also returned with the value of ASSIGNED_STR_ID is "reserved".
# In practice that should be zero.
#
# This can be tested with:
#    sg_stream_ctl --open --inhex=<this_file>
# and the ASSIGNED_STR_ID field should be 3 .
# Note the the '--open' option is needed to flag that the response data
# is from a SCSI STREAM CONTROL command.
#
# For a GET STREAM STATUS command example see the stream_ctl_get.hex file .
