# Using Caching mode page [0x8] [SBC-4]
#
# want to change WCE from 1 to 0
# Possible invocation:
#   sg_wr_mode -p 8 --cfile=wr_mode_cont.hex --mfile=wr_mode_mask.hex /dev/sdc
#
# As shown, that invocaton will not save the change so the next power cycle
# (or reset) will revert that change. Add the --save option to make the
# change persist through a power cycle.
#
# Assume WCE is set like this:
# 08 12 14 00 ff ff 00 00  ff ff ff ff 80 14 00 00
# 00 00 00 00
#
# This is the new cotents we want (byte 2 changes from 14 to 10 (hex)):
08 12 10 00 ff ff 00 00  ff ff ff ff 80 14 00 00
00 00 00 00
#
# To change it back, swap which hex string above is commented, or power
# cycle the disk.
